# asteroidos.org

> Official website and documentation for AsteroidOS

## Quickstart

Assemble and Grunt are used to build the site. To get started:

1. Make sure you have the following installed:
   * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Run:
   ``` Bash
   git clone https://github.com/AsteroidOS/asteroidos.org.git # Clone this repository
   cd asteroidos.org # Go to the root of the repo
   npm install # Install dependencies
   npx grunt # Build the site (If your npm version is so old that it doesn't support npx, run `npm i -g grunt` followed by `grunt` instead)
   ```

If all worked properly, you should have your website ready in an `_asteroidos.org` folder
