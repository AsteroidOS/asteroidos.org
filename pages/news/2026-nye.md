To mark the beginning of the year, we’ve coordinated with community members from around the world to capture the first moments of 2026. This collage shows AsteroidOS running on various watches across different time zones, reflecting our global reach.

# 11 Years of AsteroidOS
As of 2026, AsteroidOS has entered its 11th year of active development. We actually passed our 10-year milestone in June 2025, having started the project back in 2015. While we missed the exact anniversary date for a big celebration, the project’s longevity remains a point of pride.

AsteroidOS is a labor of love, developed entirely by volunteers in their free time. This means our pace is measured, but it also ensures that the project remains independent and driven by genuine interest rather than corporate pressure.

# 2025 Recap: Apps and Infrastructure
The past year saw several practical additions and major technical updates:

* **New Applications:** We introduced a Run Tracker and a Shopping List app, alongside two new games.
* **Walnascar Update:** We successfully completed the transition of our Yocto infrastructure to the **Walnascar** release last autumn. Our current nightly builds are already based on this new foundation.
* **Modernization:** Significant work was put into exploring a Qt6 migration. While this remains a long-term goal, it is a complex task that will not land with the 2.0 release.
* **Community Engagement:** Our Matrix channels remain continuously active, serving as the main hub for coordination and daily discussion.

# The Road to 2.0 and the New QuickPanel
Our main focus for 2026 is the official release of **AsteroidOS 2.0**. It is important to note that our nightly builds always reflect the current state of development and already offer feature parity with what will become 2.0. The goal of the 2.0 release is to provide a stable "stop point"—a verified version for users who prefer a reliable experience over the potential edge-case issues that come with rapid changes in the nightlies.

One of the most visible changes in 2.0 is the **QuickPanel**. We have completely overhauled the old quicksettings at the top of the screen to be modular and customizable. It now includes toggles for WiFi and, notably, Sound. This UI overhaul was a necessary step before enabling system sounds by default; we wanted to ensure users have a quick and reliable way to mute their devices.

# Meet us at FOSDEM 2026
We will be present at **FOSDEM 2026 (January 31st & February 1st)** at the shared "Linux on Mobile" table. If you are in Brussels that weekend, come by for a hands-on look at the current state of version 2.0 and see AsteroidOS running on various supported hardware.

# Contributions
Finally, a sincere thank you to everyone who contributed in 2025—whether by writing code, testing builds, or documenting issues on GitHub. Your feedback is essential to our progress.

If you’d like to get involved, feel free to join our Matrix channels and introduce yourself.

**We wish you all a successful and healthy 2026!**
