summary: The freenode network as we know it ceased to exist and the AsteroidOS project will use Matrix going forward.

<p>freenode, the IRC network we used to discuss and support AsteroidOS, no longer exists in the form we knew and loved.
The network is currently in hostile-takeover by a commercial entity and a huge number of the freenode staff have resigned. <a href="https://gist.github.com/jesopo/45a3e9cdbe517dc55e6058eb43b00ed9">They</a> <a href="https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt">explain</a> the <a href="https://gist.github.com/aaronmdjones/1a9a93ded5b7d162c3f58bdd66b8f491">circumstances</a> a lot better than we ever could.</p>

<h1>Going Forward</h1>

<p>The core team of AsteroidOS decided to move to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol)">Matrix</a>, a federated and modern communication protocol.</p>

<p></b>We will be available under: <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org">#Asteroid:matrix.org</a>.</b></p>

<p>To join us visit the chat <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org">here</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you with questions about Matrix, there is an elaborate FAQ on the <a href="https://matrix.org/faq/">matrix.org page</a> that I can recommend to everyone interested.</p>

<h1>Closing Words</h1>

<p>The AsteroidOS team hoped to end the long drought of news on a positive note, but with the current situation we felt that it is important to inform our users and contributors about the situation on freenode and our action regarding it.</p>

<p>A lot has happened after the 1.0 release, and we hope to be back with more delightful news in the coming months.</p>
