    <h4>Heart rate sensor not working?</h4>
    <p>Your watch likely ran a very old version of WearOS. Please update WearOS to at least Marshmallow.</p>
    <p>See <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/watch-urbane/rom-ext4all-skin1980-t3341598">https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/watch-urbane/rom-ext4all-skin1980-t3341598</a> for a firmware that is confirmed to fix this issue.</p>
    <p>Then install AsteroidOS again, now the heart rate sensor should work.</p>
