<div class="callout callout-warning">
    <p>This watch has a pair of physical hands embedded between the display and touchscreen panel. This obviously compromises the usability of the interface as the hands are a permanent obstruction. If you do not own one already, it is recommended to do a lot of research before buying.</p>
