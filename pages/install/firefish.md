    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Fossil Gen 4 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the USB pads on the watch, this can be achieved by removing the plastic back cover. Using heat and a prying tool, it is fairly straightforward to remove. Pay attention to the flex cable that connects to the back cover to the topside of the PCB. It is recommended to start prying on the side opposite of the buttons.</p>
    <p>Then you can solder wires to connect a USB cable to the watch. The image below indicates the function of each pad.</p>
