    <h4>Model number and variants</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>Various manufacturers market products with the same underlying platform as the Fossil Gen 5.</p>

    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Fossil Gen 5 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the USB pads on the watch, this can be achieved by removing the plastic back cover. Using heat and a prying tool, it is fairly straightforward to remove. Pay attention to the flex cable that connects the back cover to the topside of the PCB. It is recommended to start prying on the side opposite of the buttons.</p>
    <p>You should make a custom dock to connect a USB cable to the watch. Soldering directly to the watch USB pads is a bad idea since those are very thin and break easily.</p>
    <p>A 3D printable dock that can be used to interface with the watch, but requires pogo pins, is available to download here: <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/649197-fossil-gen5-carlyle-triggerfish-usb-developer-dock">https://www.printables.com/model/649197-fossil-gen5-carlyle-triggerfish-usb-developer-dock</a>. This is only tested with the Fossil Gen5 Carlyle, other variants have different dimensions and might be incompatible.</p>
