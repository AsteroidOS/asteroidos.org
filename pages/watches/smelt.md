    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Moto 360 2015 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the pads of the watch, by removing the plastic outer ring on the back. This can be straightforward when the ring lifts up by putting a fingernail or plectrum underneath the small lip. Some users report however, that the ring was glued fairly tight and needed heating before it started to come loose.</p>
    <p>You should make a custom dock to connect a USB cable to the watch. Soldering directly to the watch USB pads is a bad idea since those are very thin and break easily. The image below indicates the function of each pad.</p>

    <p>A 3D printable dock that can be used to interface with the watch, but requires pogo pins, is available to download here: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4366014">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4366014</a>.</p>
