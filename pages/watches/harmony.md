    <h4>Model number and variants</h4>
    <p>This port of AsteroidOS should cover multiple watches as listed above.</p>
    <p>MTK6580 based watches are marketed as different versions from different manufacturers. There are two known versions that are compatible with a range of MTK6580 based watches. These two versions are referred to as <code>harmony</code> and <code>inharmony</code>.</p>
    <p>However, please note that only the Kingwear KW88 has been rigorously tested. Other watches have been reported to have various bugs, for instance the Zeblaze Thor has non working touchscreen. The Lemfo LES1 and Zeblaze Thor 3G have a screen rotated by 45Â° or the KW88 Pro requires a different scatter file.</p>
