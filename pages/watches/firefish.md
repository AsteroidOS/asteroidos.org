    <h4>Model number and variants</h4>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Fossil Gen 4 is marketed as different versions from different manufacturers.

    These two versions are referred to as <code>firefish</code> and <code>ray</code>.  One difference between the two is that <code>firefish</code> has a larger display than <code>ray</code>.
    </p><p>
    Generally, models that start with DW6 are compatible with <code>firefish</code>. Models that start with DW7 are compatible with <code>ray</code>.

    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Fossil Gen 4 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the USB pads on the watch, this can be achieved by removing the plastic back cover. Using heat and a prying tool, it is fairly straightforward to remove. Pay attention to the flex cable that connects the back cover to the topside of the PCB. It is recommended to start prying on the side opposite of the buttons.</p>
    <p>You should make a custom dock to connect a USB cable to the watch. Soldering directly to the watch USB pads is a bad idea since those are very thin and break easily. The image below indicates the function of each pad.</p>

    <p>A 3D printable dock that can be used to interface with the watch, but requires pogo pins, is available to download here: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5083434">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5083434</a>. This is only tested with the Skagen Falster 2, other variants have different dimensions and might be incompatible.</p>
