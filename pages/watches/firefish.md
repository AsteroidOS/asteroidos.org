    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Fossil Gen 4 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the USB pads on the watch, this can be achieved by removing the plastic back cover. Using heat and a prying tool, it is fairly straightforward to remove. Pay attention to the flex cable that connects to the back cover to the topside of the PCB. It is recommended to start prying on the side opposite of the buttons.</p>
    <p>Then you can solder wires or use a custom dock to connect a USB cable to the watch. The image below indicates the function of each pad.</p>
    <p>Be careful when soldering wires to the pads as the pads on the watch are very fragile.</p>

    <p>A 3D printable dock that can be used to interface with the watch, but requires pogo pins, is available to download here: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5083434">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5083434</a>. This is only tested with the Skagen Falster 2, other variants have different dimensions and might be incompatible.</p>
