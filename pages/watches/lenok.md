    <h4>Heart rate sensor not working?</h4>
    <p>Your watch likely ran a very old version of WearOS. Please update WearOS to at least Marshmallow.</p>
    <p>See <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/2017-09-07-nws2-170620-003-fastboot-twrp-zip-factory-images.3405311/">https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/2017-09-07-nws2-170620-003-fastboot-twrp-zip-factory-images.3405311/</a> for a firmware that <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/issues/159#issuecomment-1440867629">is confirmed to fix this issue</a>.</p>
    <p>Then install AsteroidOS again, now the heart rate sensor should work.</p>
