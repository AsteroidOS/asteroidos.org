    <p>Hardware support notes:</p>
    <p>Dual-Display support<br> Is marked partial due to incomplete support. The secondary LCD works on all models and shows the time and steps when enabled. However, enabling the step counter and the timepiece mode is currently not available through the user interface.</p>
    <p>GPS support<br> Is marked partial because GPS is integrated into the modem in the catshark model, which is currently not supported. GPS works without issues on the catfish and catfish_ext models.</p>
