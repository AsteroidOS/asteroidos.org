    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The TicWatch Pro 3 does expose a USB connection. The charger is only used for charging.</p>
    <p>You should make a custom dock to connect a USB cable to the watch. Soldering directly to the watch USB pads is a bad idea since those are very thin and break easily.</p>
    <p>A 3D printable dock that can be used to interface with the watch, but requires pogo pins, is available to download here: <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/issues/175">https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/issues/175</a>.</p>
