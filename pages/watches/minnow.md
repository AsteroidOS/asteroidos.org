    <h4>USB connection</h4>
    <p>The Moto 360 doesn't expose a USB connection. It is however possible to connect to the watch using an adapter cable.</p>
    <p>You will need access to the pads of the watch, this can be achieved be removing the FCC sticker on the bottom of the watch behind the watchband.</p>
    <p>Then you can connect to those pins by creating a USB adapter cable. See <a href="https://rootjunky.com/moto-360-adapter-usb-cable/">https://rootjunky.com/moto-360-adapter-usb-cable/</a> for instructions on how to create the cable.</p>
