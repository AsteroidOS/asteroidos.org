<p>We expect all members of the AsteroidOS community to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all AsteroidOS community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to AsteroidOS affairs.</p>
<p>This policy covers the usage of AsteroidOS public infrastructure, including the AsteroidOS IRC channel, as well as other AsteroidOS websites, AsteroidOS related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of the AsteroidOS community. It also applies to behavior in the context of the AsteroidOS project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, communication channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of AsteroidOS services.</p>
<p>The definitions of various subjective terms such as “discriminatory”, “hateful”, or “confusing” will be decided at the sole discretion of the AsteroidOS abuse team.</p>

  <h1 id="fhfs">Friendly Harassment-Free Space</h1>
</div>
<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.</p>
<p>We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.</p>
<p>Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.</p>
<p>Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non- physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of Conduct, please contact kido on irc.libera.chat or one of the admins of the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org">#Asteroid:matrix.org</a> channel to send an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.
<div class="page-header">
  <h1 id="consequences">Consequences</h1>
</div>
<p>All content published to public AsteroidOS infrastructure is hosted at the sole discretion of AsteroidOS team.</p>
<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the AsteroidOS team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.</p>
<div class="page-header">
  <h1 id="addressing">Addressing Grievances</h1>
</div>
<p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the AsteroidOS abuse team. We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.</p>
<p>In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.</p>
<p>On IRC, let one of the ops know if you think that someone has transgressed against the Code of Conduct.</p>
