title: Creating an Asteroid app
layout: documentation
---

The app creation process of AsteroidOS needs a Software Development Kit generated by OpenEmbedded. You can either grab a prebuilt SDK for the nightlies [here](https://release.asteroidos.org/nightlies/sdk/oecore-x86_64-armv7vet2hf-neon-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh) and install it on your system or you can build it yourself as follows:

# Building the Cross Compilation Toolchain

---

If you’ve already got an OpenEmbedded build directory via the [Building AsteroidOS]({{rel 'wiki/building-asteroidos'}}) page, cd to that directory. Else, create one with:

```
git clone https://github.com/AsteroidOS/asteroid
cd asteroid/
```

Then, build the cross compilation toolchain with:

```
source ./prepare-build.sh dory
bitbake meta-toolchain-qt5
```

# Install the SDK

---

If you downloaded a prebuilt SDK, run the downloaded script. If you followed the previous steps, this will have generated the same installation script in _tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/_, you can run it as follows:

```
./tmp-glibc/deploy/sdk/oecore-x86_64-armv7vet2hf-neon-toolchain-nodistro.0.sh
```

This script will install the cross-compiler and ARM libraries in _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64_ by default, along with a script that needs to be sourced before every build. If you want to build a simple project via the terminal, this can be done like that:

```
source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7vet2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
qmake
make
```


# Configure QtCreator for cross compilation

---

Before running QtCreator you must run the previously mentioned script:

```
source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7vet2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
qtcreator
```

This can be done automatically by prepending "source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7vet2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi" before #!/bin/sh in _/usr/bin/qtcreator.sh_

Now that you are in QtCreator go to ‘_Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Devices_‘

- Add a new Generic Linux Device.
- Name it "AsteroidOS Watch".
- Choose 192.168.2.15 as IP address.
- Use root as user.
- Choose Password authentication and leave the password field empty.


Under the '_Kits_'

- In the Compilers tab add the following GCC (C++): _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr/bin/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi-g++_ and GCC (C): _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr/bin/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi-gcc_
- In the Debuggers tab add the following gdb: _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr/bin/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi/arm-oe-linux-gnueabi-gdb_
- In the Qt Versions tab add the following qmake: _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr/bin/qmake_
- In the Kits tab add a kit with the previously defined device, Qt5 version and compilers, set the sysroot to _/usr/local/oecore-x86_64/sysroots/armv7vet2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi/_ and let the other variables empty.

# First app

---

[Asteroid-Stopwatch](https://github.com/AsteroidOS/asteroid-stopwatch) can act as a cool QML demo app to make your first steps into AsteroidOS development easier. You can clone it, build it, install it and then modify it to follow your needs:

```
git clone https://github.com/AsteroidOS/asteroid-stopwatch
cd asteroid-stopwatch/
./i18n/generate-desktop.sh . asteroid-stopwatch.desktop
source /usr/local/oecore-x86_64/environment-setup-armv7vet2hf-neon-oe-linux-gnueabi
qtcreator asteroid-stopwatch.pro
```

Try to build and deploy the app. If it wasn’t already installed, a new icon should have already appeared on asteroid-launcher.

You can start by modifying occurrences of “asteroid-stopwatch” to your app’s name. Then you can change the *.desktop file which describes the icon on the apps launcher. Then modify main.qml to describe your UI. To get started with QML development you can read the [official tutorial](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-tutorial.html).

# Tips and tricks

---

If you want to start your app from the command line, open a shell with [SSH]({{rel 'wiki/ssh'}}), connect to ceres and use invoker:

```
invoker --type=qtcomponents-qt5 /usr/bin/asteroid-stopwatch
```
**TODO:** Document the integration of this invoker command as a run step in the Qt Creator configuration.

If you want to disable screen locking for easier development you can enable the demo mode of mce as root with:

```
mcetool -D on
```
