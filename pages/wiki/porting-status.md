# WearOS Smartwatches
---

The WearOS smartwatches are the most widespread and easy to support. The source code of their kernels is usually easily available and the drivers can be supported with [libhybris](https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris). Those watches are the current priority of AsteroidOS.

# Tizen Smartwatches
---

The Samsung Gear S2, S2 Classic and S3 might be supported by AsteroidOS in the future but they will require more work than the other watches. Someone already got interested in the S2 port but gave up because he couldn’t find the kernel’s defconfig.

# Other Smartwatches
---

There are many Android (non-Wear) smartwatches available for a lower price. (e.g: the Omate *, Sony SW, Intex iRist, zWatch etc…) It might be more difficult to get access to the kernel’s or android tree of those devices but libhybris could also make running AsteroidOS on top of them possible. This is typically the case of the MTK6580 watches.

Other low-end smartwatches using cheap Mediatek SoCs aren’t able to run a Linux kernel and can’t be supported by AsteroidOS.
