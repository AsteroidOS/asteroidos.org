<p>AsteroidOS translations are managed through <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/">Weblate</a>, a Free/Open Source web translation platform. To be able to use it, you will have to <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/">register an account</a>, although you can also log in through a few popular third-party services. The rest of this page assumes you have an account.</p>
