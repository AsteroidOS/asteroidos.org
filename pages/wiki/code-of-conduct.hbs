<p>We expect all members of the AsteroidOS&nbsp;community&nbsp;to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times in all AsteroidOS community&nbsp;venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one communications pertaining to AsteroidOS&nbsp;affairs.</p>
<p>This policy covers the usage of AsteroidOS&nbsp;public infrastructure, including the AsteroidOS IRC channel, as well as other AsteroidOS&nbsp;websites, AsteroidOS&nbsp;related events, and any other services offered by or on behalf of the AsteroidOS&nbsp;community. It also applies to behavior in the context of the AsteroidOS&nbsp;project communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, communication channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of AsteroidOS&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>The definitions of various subjective terms such as “discriminatory”, “hateful”, or “confusing” will be decided at the sole discretion of the AsteroidOS&nbsp;abuse team.</p>

  <h1 id="fhfs">Friendly Harassment-Free Space</h1>
</div>
<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.</p>
<p>We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.</p>
<p>Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.</p>
<p>Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non- physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

  <h1 id="consequences">Consequences</h1>
</div>

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community&nbsp;member will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>
